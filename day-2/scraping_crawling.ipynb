    "# Scraping and crawling the web\n",
    "\n",
    "This second day's workshop gives you practice scraping and crawling with modern Python tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "To review from yesterday, web-scraping means “programatically going over a collection of web pages and extracting data”. Scraping is a powerful tool for working with data on the web, and it has two core steps. First, you find web pages and download them via web requests (often called *web-crawling*). Then you extract and parse information from these pages (often called *web-scraping*). These two steps often happen together and recursively: you crawl some stuff, but upon scraping it you realize you got the wrong websites, so you go back to crawling, which changes your scraping approach, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start today with the essential tools for web-scraping or _narrow crawling_ (focused, precise scraping of a few websites): making requests (with `Requests`) and parsing HTML (with `BeautifulSoup`). Then we will dig into `Scrapy`, a flexible and powerful tool for crawling and scraping heterogeneous websites (what I call _broad crawling_).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standing on the shoulders of... spiders?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can build a scraper from scratch using low-level modules or libraries, but then you have to deal with some potential headaches as your scraper grows more complex. For example, you'll need to handle concurrency so you can crawl more than one page at a time. You'll probably want to figure out how to transform your scraped data into different formats like CSV, XML, or JSON. And you'll sometimes have to deal with sites that require specific settings and access patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll have better luck if you build your scraper on top of an existing library that handles those issues for you. For this tutorial, we will build some intuition for web-scraping by working with low-level approaches, using the `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to make requests and parse the result. Then we will build a scraper with *Scrapy*,which is one of the most popular, flexible, and powerful Python scraping libraries. Scrapy takes a \"batteries included\" approach to scraping, meaning that it handles a lot of the common functionality that all scrapers need. This prevents you from reinventing the wheel--or worse, the flat tire!\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about crawling with Scrapy, we will explore [quotes.toscrape.com](quotes.toscrape.com), a scraping-friendly website that lists quotes from famous authors. By the end of today, you’ll have a fully functional web scraper that walks through a series of pages and extracts data from each page. The scraper will be easily expandable so you can tinker around with it and use it as a foundation for your own projects scraping data from the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read more about the [basics of scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html), its [architecture](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html), or see [the FAQ](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/faq.html). And if you need a refresher on scraping with Beautiful Soup, here's a [good tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-scrape-web-pages-with-beautiful-soup-and-python-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What kind of crawling?\n",
    "\n",
    "A flexible tool like Scrapy can be used in many different ways depending on the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I call _narrow crawling_ means focusing on a limited set of pre-defined domains--that is, studying their HTML and CSS structures and exploiting these to extract specific information repeatedly. This maximizes precision in scraping while sacrificing _extensibility_: the ability to incorporate new domains or be resilient to changes in website structure. This is what people usually mean when they say \"web-scraping\". It may or may not expand beyond the initial set of websites, but it may crawl more websites within this set (_vertical crawling_).\n",
    "\n",
    "What I call _broad crawling_ makes the opposite tradeoff, collecting information on a range of websites and promoting flexibility in its scraping algorithm (way of extracting website information) at the expense of generally less clean output. It may identify websites to scrape by google search (what do people click on most?), network analysis (what websites tend to link to one another?), or _link extraction_: finding all within-domain links on a given webpage, then all within-domain links on its children links, and so on to a specified depth. The messier output from broad crawling can present challenges for data cleaning and analysis (remember \"garbage in, garbage out\"?), but this depends on the application.\n",

    "As a _Twisted_ application, Scrapy is event-driven, asynchronous, and is virtually multi-threaded (while using only one thread). While other programs cause _blocks_ when they access files or the web, spawn new processes, or do system operations, Scrapy instead waits until a resource is available, solves the immediate problem, and then calls another task. In short, Scrapy is fast, flexible, and scalable. It offers one of the most user-friendly ways to write crawling programs that can move across heterogeneous swaths of the internet, download stuff, and not break. \n",
    "\n",
    "To grasp the intuition behind Scrapy, imagine a bank where tellers (threads) are available to see customers (processes), who need to fill out forms before they're done. Such a situation could be configured in these ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Blocking_ operation with a _single_ thread: Here there is 1 teller trying to help 5 customers. When customer 1 needs time to fill out a form, then teller 1 is occupied waiting for customer 1--and all the other customers are stuck in line.\n",
    "- _Blocking_ operation with _multiple_ threads: Now there are still 5 customers, but there are 3 tellers. When customer 1 needs time to fill out a form, then teller 1 is occupied. Customer 2 may have access to teller 2 and customer 3 to teller 3, but then all the tellers are monopolized while people fill out forms, which means customers 4 and 5 are still stuck waiting in line. \n",
    "- _Non-blocking_ operation with a _single_ thread: Here again we have 1 teller and 5 customers. When customer 1 needs time to fill out a form, they stand aside so the single teller can help customer 2. When customer 1 is finished, they wait until customer 2 is done or has something to do, then customer 1 is called back to continue being helped. If customers 1 and 2 both have forms to complete, they can do that on the side and the single teller can see customer 3, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this last situation is way more efficient than the previous two. This is the Scrapy default; when _multiple_ threads are available for a _non-blocking_ operation (like when multiple spiders work together), this is even better. "

    "### Storing the scraped data\n",
    "The simplest way to store the scraped data is by using Feed exports, with the following command:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That will generate an quotes.json file containing all scraped items, serialized in JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "For historic reasons, Scrapy appends to a given file instead of overwriting its contents. If you run this command twice without removing the file before the second time, you’ll end up with a long JSON file--actually, a broken JSON file, which cannot be read.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use other formats, like JSON Lines:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.jl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON Lines format is useful because it’s stream-like, you can easily append new records to it. It doesn’t have the same problem of JSON when you run twice. Also, as each record is a separate line, you can process big files without having to fit everything in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In small projects (like the one in this tutorial), that should be enough. However, if you want to perform more complex things with the scraped items, you can write an Item Pipeline. A placeholder file for Item Pipelines has been set up for you when the project is created, in `schools/pipelines.py`. Though you don’t need to implement any item pipelines if you just want to store the scraped items."

    "## Link extraction in a (broad) spider <a id='linkextraction'> </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say, instead of just scraping the stuff from the first two pages from http://quotes.toscrape.com, you want quotes from all the pages in the website. We could do this by adding more URLs to the `start_urls` field, but this sounds like work. We could also read them in via a text file, but that doesn't sound any easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way would be to find the URLs of within-domain links from the website itself, extract data from these pages, go one level still further down, and so on. We could do this by identifying and extracting links using their CSS selectors, and this would let us scrape all the quotes across all the pages across this website (there are steps for this in [the `Scrapy` tutorial](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html)). But CSS selectors are site-specific, so what about other websites? Could we use `Scrapy` to crawl all the links reliably across different kinds of websites?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! In fact, this kind of _broad crawling_ is (arguably) where `Scrapy` shines the most. Crawlers typically mix _horizontal crawling_, crawling pages at the same hierarchical level (for example, from `school.com/page1` to `school.com/page2`), with _vertical crawling_, moving from a higher hierarchical level (for example, `school.com/main`) to a lower one (for example, `school.com/main/about_us`). `Scrapy` makes doing both of these easy by providing the `CrawlSpider` class, from which we can borrow using the `genspider` command:\n",

    "$ scrapy genspider -t crawl broad http://quotes.toscrape.com  # borrows from `crawl` spider template\n",

    "  schools.spiders.broad\n",
    "```\n",
    "Go ahead and execute this command in your terminal, and check out the resulting file in `schools/spiders/broad.py`. It should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BroadSpider(CrawlSpider):\n",
    "    name = 'broad'\n",
    "    allowed_domains = ['http://quotes.toscrape.com']\n",

    "        item = {}\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        return item\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's worth explaining this a bit. `CrawlSpider` provides an implementation of the `parse()` method that uses the `rules` variable to allow easy two-direction (both horizontal and vertical) crawling. For instance, `Scrapy` by default avoids duplicate requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unless a callback is set, a Rule will follow the extracted URLs, which means that it will scan target pages for extra links and follow them. If a callback is set, the Rule won't follow the links from target pages. If you would like it to follow links, you should either return/yield them from your callback method, or set the follow argument of Rule() to true (which is what we will do). \n",
    "\n",
    "How does this spider find links to follow? As their name implies, LinkExtractors are specialized in extracting links, so by default, they are looking for the `a` (and `area`) `href` HTML tags or attributes. Links are ordered using by  \"last in, first out\", meaning that it scrapes a page and all its sublinks before visiting the next page.\n",
